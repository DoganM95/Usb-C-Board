# Usb-C-Pcb

This repository contains the design files for a simple yet versatile USB-C PCB. It's designed to deliver 5 volts with USB 2.0 data pin support and includes power delivery capabilities. And yes, ChatGPT created this readme, so don't wonder.

## Features

- **5V Output:** The board outputs a stable 5 volts, suitable for various USB-powered devices.
- **Power Delivery Support:** For power delivery functionality, add two 5.1 KOhm resistors of size 0603 in the designated rectangles.
- **Mounting Holes:** Strategically placed drill holes on the sides allow for easy mounting.
- **Cut Limit Line:** A clearly marked cut limit line indicates the maximum cuttable range of the PCB without losing functionality.
- **Enhanced Power Wires:** Thick VCC and GND wires are designed to support high amperage loads.

Feel free to explore the design files, contribute, and suggest improvements to this project.
